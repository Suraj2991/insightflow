# InsightFlow Property â€“ UK Property Document Review Assistant

**2025-06 Update: Robust, Reliable, User-Friendly**

InsightFlow is an AI-powered decision support tool for UK property buyers. It reviews property documents, highlights risks, and helps users prepare questions for professionals. The system uses OpenAI/Groq function calling, strict schema validation, robust error handling, and integrates user survey data (risk tolerance, property type, etc.) for context-aware analysis. The UI is designed for clarity, progress tracking, and resilience to missing/incomplete data.

**Key Features:**
- Function calling for document analysis and question generation (no JSON parsing errors)
- Strict schema enforcement and fallback logic
- Survey data integration (risk tolerance, property type, professional team)
- Robust error handling and defensive UI coding
- Simplified, user-friendly workflow and progress tracking

**Workflow:**
1. Complete property questionnaire
2. Upload documents
3. Receive structured analysis (summary, findings, questions)
4. Prepare for professional consultation
